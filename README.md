# Pepe
Pepe is a total occupancy calculator. Since the beginning of time, people have used the method of counting to keep track of a large group of people. If the number of people you count at the end equals the number at the beginning, then you know everyone is present. But what if no one started counting? How would you know? Or the police? Or the fire department?...

Pepe was created using C++, OpenCV, and Web API's (dweet.io and freeboard.io) Using OpenCV libraries and dweet.io, the program transfers data collected to a website updated every 5 seconds on freeboard.io. It displays data including: maximum occupany, current room/buidling occupancy, temperature, building location, and whether the building is occupied or empty.
